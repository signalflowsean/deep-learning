## K-Means
1. Choose the number of k clusters
2. Select at random K points, the centroids 
3. Assign each data point to the closest centroid --> That forms K clusters
4. Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster
5. Reassign each data point to the new closest centrod. If any reassignment took place go to step 4, else we're done!
